  <h2 class='c004'>A FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>There was a time—and that not so very long ago—when popular ignorance
and superstition looked upon an insane person as one possessed of
the devil or of some other evil spirit. They sought to drive the “evil one”
out by beating and torturing the insane, and often even by drowning, hanging,
and burning.</p>

<p class='c006'>We have fortunately passed that stage of stupid brutality. Today even
the most ignorant man knows that insanity is a disease. But in regard to
crime and criminals we are still in the stage of dark-age superstition. We
look upon the criminal today as we did upon the insane fifty or seventy-five
years ago. Most men still believe that by beating and punishing the criminal,
by hanging and electrocution, we can drive the “evil spirit” out of
him. This process is called reforming the criminal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet common sense and all human experience prove that the criminal
is no more responsible for crime than the crazy man for his insanity. The
pseudo-scientific theories of the Lombrosos in regard to crime and criminals
have been thoroughly exploded and proven utterly fallacious. Even if the
Lombroso myth that the criminal is born were true, what good would it do
to punish him? There might be some social justification for his isolation,
but how could the criminal, if born such, be held accountable for his criminality?</p>

<p class='c006'>But as a matter of fact—as modern criminology has proven beyond all
dispute—the criminal is made, not born. He is the product of his environment,
a child of poverty and desperation, of misery, greed, and ambition.
He is at the same time the symbol and the proof of a diseased social condition,
the miscarriage of perverted economic arrangements. Fully 97 per cent.
of all crime is due directly to our economic institutions. The other 3 per
cent. are traceable to the artificiality and neurosis of modern life, to the anti-social
tendencies cultivated among the weeds in the neglected and mistreated
garden of human life.</p>

<p class='c006'>I have been in close contact with so-called criminals for a great many
years. Yet nowhere have I found the alleged “criminal type,” nor have I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>ever discovered the “real criminal.” He does not exist. Crime is simply
misdirected energy, effort applied wrongly. The average criminal is just
the average man, generally speaking. If in any sense he may be considered
a “variation,” it is only because of his frequently superior initiative, daring
and intelligence. His often anti-social activity is conditioned by his unconventional
vocation, not by any inherent criminal or anti-social tendencies.
I am not speaking of congenital criminal degenerates whose number is infinitesimal,
and who belong in the care of the alienist. The vast majority
of the so-called criminal class are thoroughly normal human beings, if the
term may be applied to the type of man produced by modern civilization. I
have had scores and hundreds of professional criminals, young and old, tell
me again and again, “The only hope and ambition of my life is just to get a
little pile, so that I can feel secure from want. Then I’d take my family
somewhere in the country and live a quiet and honest life.”</p>

<p class='c006'>My present space is limited. I can merely shadow forth here a skeleton
outline of this big and very vital subject. In a forthcoming book I shall
analyze more thoroughly the sources and the psychology of crime, and write
of the unique and interesting prison types and characters I have met.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the present it is sufficient to emphasize that our whole social attitude
toward the criminal is fundamentally wrong. It is the attitude of barbaric
stupidity that seeks to hide its own shame and its mistakes behind prison
bars. It has neither understanding of human motives nor sympathy with
human weaknesses. This social attitude toward the criminal, representing
the lowest human intelligence, is reflected in the management and discipline
of the prisons. It is apparent that modern criminology has had a very
negligible effect upon the popular mind within the last twenty-five years, for
I have found the prisons of today in no essential way different from those of
a quarter of a century back. Brutality is rampant; discipline is synonymous
with the absolute suppression of individuality and the crushing of the
prisoner’s spirit and will. The atmosphere of our penal institutions of today
is that of violence and force, of force and violence. With very rare exceptions,
the spirit of humanity, of understanding, and justice, is a stranger in
prison.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE STATE PRISON AT JEFFERSON CITY, MO.<br /> <span class='large'>EMMA GOLDMAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Twenty-six years ago, in 1893, I paid the first toll for my opinions
in the State of New York with a year’s free residence in the Blackwell’s
Island Penitentiary. I found the cells small, dark, and filthy, the sanitary
conditions appalling, and the general attitude toward the convict on the
part of prison officials hard and cruel.</p>

<p class='c006'>Terrible as these conditions were, they had some justification. In
1893 there was barely a spark anywhere to discredit the antiquated and
inhuman theory of predestination—the Calvinistic idea that man is born
a sinner and that he must expiate his sins through suffering and pain. This
attitude toward the criminal and the methods of punishment rest on this
biblical conception to this very day. Much more did that idea prevail
twenty-six years ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since then criminology has undergone a revolution. Libraries are
filled with works on the origin and causes of crime, on the futility of punishment
as a corrective of crime. More and more frequently modern writers
have pointed out that crimes are related to social conditions, and that brutal
treatment of prisoners makes them become more hardened and anti-social.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a vast literature on scientific criminology and the widespread
attempt to reform prisons, to humanize the treatment of the unfortunate
social offender, one might have expected some changes in the penal institutions
of this country. Yet in the year 1918 in the States of Missouri and
Georgia, and for aught we know in every State in the land, prisons continue
to be “built of bricks of shame” and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The vilest deeds, like poison weeds,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Bloom well in prison air.</div>
      <div class='line'>It is only what is good in Man</div>
      <div class='line in2'>That wastes and withers there.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pale anguish keeps the heavy gate,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the Warder is Despair.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>To be sure, the cells in the Missouri State Penitentiary, at least in the
female wing, are larger and some of them lighter than the vermin-infested
cells on Blackwell’s Island twenty-six years ago. But even there the cells
are never light enough except on very sunny days, while more than half
the cells are in utter darkness and without ventilation. In fact, air is the
most tabooed article in the Missouri prison. Except in extremely warm
weather, the windows are rarely opened, healthy women are forced to breathe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the putrid air of consumptives and syphilitics. During the influenza epidemic,
when thirty-five prisoners lay stricken, we had to plead and fight
for the opening of a window. To this day I can not understand how any
one of us survived, except that the Lord “takes care of us poor sinners.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Yes, the cells are larger, the sanitation modern, but in every other
respect, in the attitude of the officials toward the prisoner, the cold indifference
to his needs, the methods of breaking his will, and, above all, the
mode of employment have not improved, but are even worse than my experience
on Blackwell’s Island in 1893.</p>

<p class='c006'>I cannot dwell here on the blood-freezing reception accorded each
hopeless victim when the prison doors close upon her. That alone is enough
to crush the bravest spirit and to turn one’s very soul to gall and hate. I
shall treat of this in my forthcoming book, dealing with my twenty months’
experience in the Missouri State Prison.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is the task system that prevails in this prison—as truly slavery
as ever existed in this country before the Civil War—which chiefly needs
to be exposed. The contract system of prison labor has been abolished
“officially”—the State is now the employer. Yet no slave owner so drove,
coerced and exploited his slaves as Missouri bleeds and exploits its helpless
victims in the penitentiary at Jefferson City.</p>

<p class='c006'>Two months are allowed to learn the trade, which consists of sewing
jackets, overalls, auto coats and suspenders—tasks varying from 45 to 121
jackets a day, or from 9 to 18 dozen suspenders a day. Now, while the
actual machine work on these different tasks is the same, the number of
jackets in the 88 or 121 tasks is double to the 45, 55 and 66 tasks; hence double
physical exertion is required. Yet the different tasks must be made in the
same number of hours, without regard to age, physical endurance, periods
of menstruation, when machine work is sheer torture to women. Even illness,
unless it is of a very serious nature, is not considered sufficient cause
to be relieved from the terrible task. So, unless one had previous experience
in the needle trade, or a special aptitude for it, one’s life is made a
veritable hell, beginning a few days after commitment and lasting till the
final day of release. No understanding for human variations, no consideration
for mental or physical limitations, except for a few favorites of
the prison officials, those who are usually the most worthless. The shop
foreman in charge is a boy of twenty-one, who took up the art of slave-driving
at the age of sixteen. He bullies and terrorizes the women, holding
the threat of the blind cell and the bread-and-water diet over them.</p>

<p class='c006'>The vilest language is used to the women, some of them old enough
to be the boy’s mother. Of course, he is paid to show results. The only
way he can get results is through slave-driving methods, as well as by actually
stealing part of the women’s output, especially from the more ignorant,
who are unable to do their own counting.</p>

<p class='c006'>On more than one occasion I have seen this miserable foreman deliberately
steal jackets and suspenders from colored girls who are serving
twenty-five year sentences and from illiterate white girls. If they dare insist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>that they delivered their quota of work, they are punished for “impudence,”
in addition to being punished for “short” work. In view of the fact that
four punishment marks a month reduce the prisoner one grade, and that
a higher grade means speedier release from the prison hell, the enormity
of this petty official’s criminal thievery can be appreciated. Yet this man
is considered fit to be in charge of sixty to seventy “criminals.” It does
not take much wisdom to find the greater criminal.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be argued that this ignorant and vulgar young man is only a
tool, and therefore not to blame. Partly this is true. The State is the
real offender, the officials of the Prison Board, as well as the petty subordinates
who live by the sweat and blood of the social outcasts. The very
first year the State of Missouri became the exploiter of the convicts’ labor,
the St. Louis <cite>Post-Dispatch</cite> reported that the salaries of the prison officials
had been increased $20,000 per annum. No wonder the Acting Warden,
Captain Gilvan—a bully and a brute who used to administer flogging when
it was still “officially” in vogue in Missouri—once said to us in the shop,
“I must have the task. You must make it. No such thing as can’t. If you
do not give me the task, I will punish you. And I punish cheerfully.” Having
the support and approval of such a man and the sanction of the head
matron, a woman entirely bereft of feeling, it is natural for the foreman
to squeeze and press and bully the task out of the women. But can anyone
suppose that the foreman could lend himself to such brutal slave-driving,
if he were not depraved himself?</p>

<p class='c006'>It is utterly impossible to keep up the required speed day after day.
The working hours are nine a day, but in order to complete the task, the
women are driven to the old-time sweatshop methods of taking work evenings
to their cells. In view of the fact that the cells are vermin infested, and
the jackets and suspenders the prisoners make are sold broadcast and have
already been handled by consumptive and venereally infected male prisoners,
who prepare the work, the results can readily be imagined.</p>

<p class='c006'>Personally I was well supplied by many friends with nourishing food.
I am an adept at the needle trade, having worked at it for many years, when
I first came to know the many economic opportunities in our so-called
democracy. Yet I never could keep up the mind- and soul-destroying speed
in the prison shop. Therefore I know what it means to the underfed women
prisoners. Not one but emerges with impaired health.</p>

<p class='c006'>If the contract system were really abolished, why would the State of Missouri
drive its prison inmates? For a very simple reason: the State of
Missouri, like the private contractor, does business with private concerns
in every State of the Union. Proof of this is given by the labels sewn
on every garment that leaves the prison. I was able to smuggle out a
few, which are reproduced here.</p>

<p class='c008'>Civilization claims to have advanced, and in no country do we hear
so much about prison reform as in our own. Yet what can we say for the
State of Missouri, when at the head of their female department is a woman
in charge of ninety women prisoners who has control over their life and
death?</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
<img src='images/i_008.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>This woman, Lilah Smith, has been employed in penal institutions
since her fifteenth year, and has, therefore, little education or training. She
is a believer in rigid discipline and punishment. She is really a neurotic,
who has no control over her temper. She uses physical violence on the
slightest pretext, especially when a particular prisoner is not in her good
graces. Not once in twenty months did I hear her address one single encouraging
or kind word to a prisoner. Flogging in the State of Missouri
has been officially abolished, but Lilah Smith’s vigorous slapping goes on.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are three methods of punishment: First, the women are deprived
of their recreation; second, they are locked up in their cells for forty-eight
hours, from Saturday to Monday, on a diet of bread and water, and then
expected to begin their task Monday in their weakened condition; third,
they are sent to a blind cell, a cell 52 inches by 104 inches, with an aperture
of 7 inches by 1½ inches, supplied with one blanket, two pieces of
bread and two cups of water a day. In this tomb they are kept from three
to twenty-two days.</p>

<p class='c006'>Added to this maddening torture are the bull rings, which, while never
used for white women during my stay, were used on colored girls.</p>

<p class='c006'>The worst tragedy which occurred during my stay in the prison was
the deliberate murder of Minnie Eddy. When I entered in February, Minnie
had already been there a number of months. She struggled valiantly with
the task, which she seemed unable to master. To avoid punishment, she
used every cent her sister sent her to hire the task. In November, 1918, she
began to complain of pain in her head and throat. She went to the doctor,
but he ordered her back to the shop. She went back, but seemed unable
to pull herself together to do any work. The matron decided she was
shamming, and put her in punishment. At first she was kept in her own
cell on bread and water; then the matron, realizing that we were feeding
Minnie, transferred her to the so-called hospital, where a mattress was
refused her, and only a bare cot and blanket were supplied. In that place
the unfortunate woman was kept another week.</p>

<p class='c006'>I went to the matron shortly after Minnie was put in the hospital,
begging for her release. It was refused, the matron still insisting that
the woman was shamming. Then, Thanksgiving Day, Minnie was brought
down and allowed to eat her Thanksgiving dinner of putrid pork on an
empty stomach. Two days later I took Minnie a couple of soft-boiled
eggs, and seeing on her table a box sent by her relatives some weeks before,
and which had just been given her, I warned her against using the decayed
food in her present condition. But she was ravenous.</p>

<p class='c006'>That evening some of the prison trusties came to me and told me that
Minnie was in a heap on the floor, unconscious. I demanded that they
call Miss Smith, the matron. The matron screamed at and slapped the
unconscious woman. She was allowed to remain in her cell until Monday,
when I could endure the situation no longer, and insisted on seeing Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Painter, President of the Prison Board, who came over at once. He had
been told that Minnie was refusing food. He gave orders to have her moved
back to her own cell, and put one of the girls in charge as her nurse. From
the latter I learned that an attempt was made to feed Minnie forcibly, but
it was too late. She never regained consciousness, dying Wednesday evening,
at seven o’clock. Her terrible death benefited the other women, inasmuch
as no one was afterwards placed in the death trap for more than
five days. So do the dead sometimes aid the living.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>There are two criterions on the part of the officials in dealing with the
prisoners. If they are sick, they are told that they are shamming; if they
cannot make the task, they are told they are lazy.</i></p>

<p class='c008'>Frequently sick prisoners are ordered back to the shop by the physician
when they are barely able to drag themselves along. This is the
more remarkable because he is not an unkindly man and was especially
decent to me. The reason for his indifference to the other women there I
discovered during my last days at the prison. He is at daggers’ points
with the Board; therefore he is unable to do what he would like.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Missouri State Penitentiary has the merit system, which is only
another method of pressing out more labor from its victims. Those who
can stand the nerve-tearing speed and get into Class A, the highest class,
have their time reduced almost in half. Therefore many of the women
work beyond their limit of physical capacity to get out of the hell hole,
even at the expense of their health. However, only State prisoners benefit
by this merit system. Not so the Federal prisoners. They are forced to
make the task every day, though their time is in no way affected. Imagine
the outrage in the case of a prisoner serving a twenty-five-year sentence.
Day after day, year in and year out, she is browbeaten and harassed to
make the task. If she fails, she is repeatedly thrown into the “blind cell.”
If she succeeds, she gains nothing. The Federal Government pays the
State for the upkeep of each Federal prisoner. In addition, the State makes
a huge profit from the labor of these Federals. In return, it gives them
not a single privilege. The reduction of six days’ time a month is provided
for by the Federal Government. It is a most unspeakable injustice
toward helpless human beings.</p>

<p class='c006'>In disclosing conditions prevalent in the Female Department of the
Missouri State Penitentiary I am in no way prompted by personal grievances.
Thanks to the liberality of Mr. William K. Painter, President of
the Prison Board, and possibly also because of the fear of publicity on the
part of the management, I have no personal complaints to make. In justice
to Mr. Painter, I must say that he is a rather unusual man for his position.
Whenever his attention was called to some grievance, he was always
ready to remedy it. But prison abuses are conditioned in the very character
of prison life and in corrupt politics, so that nothing short of the complete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>abolition of prisons will ever eradicate the terrible wrongs committed in
penal institutions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Meanwhile it is necessary to continue to point out that criminals are
victims of our mad social arrangement, and to emphasize the utter failure
of punishment as a corrective, as well as to expose the average brutal and
ignorant type of prison official. The recognition of this may help to change
our better-than-thou attitude toward the criminal.</p>

<p class='c008'>As for my own experience, in all my twenty months of the closest contact
with my fellow prisoners, I did not find one I could call depraved, cruel
or hard. On the contrary, I know a “lifer” there who came to the penitentiary
hardly more than a child. She has already served fifteen years.
She is a most tender and devoted creature. She has one hold on life—a
dog, whom she loves and tends with a mother’s devotion. Who is the true
criminal—this poor heart-broken little woman or the officials who have
the power to let her spend her remaining years in freedom, and yet keep
her? Another woman, who has a fifteen-year sentence, is completely
broken in health, and in constant physical misery. She is passionately
devoted to her only child, a little boy. Is she the criminal or those who
keep her there? Her offense was the result of a moment’s aberration;
theirs is a cold-blooded, methodical and daily crime. Who is the greater
criminal? Another woman, the mother of eight children, worked and
starved half to death on a farm. She is thrown into prison for stealing
a pig. Who is the greater criminal, this poor woman or the State which
sent her there? I found no criminals among my fellow prisoners, only
unfortunates—broken, helpless, hapless and hopeless human beings.</p>

<p class='c008'>How rich in comparison are we political prisoners! Kate Richards
O’Hare, who has the gift of going into the life of every prisoner, soothing
and comforting and sustaining her, and is herself sustained by the ideal and
the love of thousands. Rare little Ella Antolini, with her marvelous stoicism,
her splendid fortitude, and her great capacity for human sympathy. We
politicals are rich, indeed. Rich in the love of our dear comrades, rich in our
faith of the future, strong in our position. But the others? It is for them
we plead, against the wrongs, the inhumanities committed against those in
the prison we left behind. Indeed, in every prison in the land.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>This country is at the present time going through the same throes of social
and industrial rebirth that are convulsing England, France and other
European countries. The steelworkers’ strike is merely one of the symptoms
of the social evolutionary process that may in the near future culminate in
revolution. The sources of labor discontent in this country are identical with
those in every other land of our so-called civilization. The working masses
are not satisfied any more with empty political democracy; they demand a
share in the products of their industry, and the opportunity to live, to enjoy
life. Industrial slavery, perhaps more acute in the United States than anywhere
else, is on its death-bed. The next step in the social life of the world
is the taking over of all industry by the workers, both manual and mental, to
be managed and operated by themselves, for the benefit of the producers
instead of for the profit of our industrial and financial Kaisers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The present struggle of the steel workers vividly calls back to my memory
the great steel strike of Homestead, in 1892, when the Pinkertons hired by
Carnegie and Frick shot the strikers down wholesale for demanding living
conditions. In connection with the Homestead strike I served fourteen years
in the Western Penitentiary of Pennsylvania. We have made some progress
since then. The workers, especially, have learned a good deal since the days
of the Homestead strike. They have learned the most important lesson of
all, and that is that labor has an invincible weapon in solidarity. That is
also the lesson that is being impressed on American labor today by the
workers of England. Soon the American Federation of Labor will realize
that it is folly to call a strike of steel workers, without at the same time securing
the solidaric support of all the other key industries—the railway men
and the miners, for instance. As long as the workers in those industries strike
separately, at different times, they run the risk of defeat. But a simultaneous
strike of all the three key industries would quickly bring our Garys, Morgans
and Fricks to their senses.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whatever the immediate outcome of the steel strike, it is but a question
of a short time before American labor will make solidaric cause throughout
all industries and assert the right of the toilers to the ownership of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>full product of their toil. The day of capitalistic autocracy is gone. The
future belongs to the proletariat of hand and brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>The present labor situation in the United States is full of promise for
the future. The war and its results have proven a great education for the
peoples of the world. They are sick of the high-sounding phrases about political
democracy and self-determination that are in practice like so many
scraps of paper. It is <i>industrial autocracy</i> that the workers of the world seek
to destroy. This country, the alleged champion of democracy, is being daily
changed more and more into the régime of Prussian militarism. The Government
of the United States has taken advantage of the alleged necessities of the
war to crush the spirit of liberty and to deprive the people of the last vestige
of freedom. It has now become dangerous, in this free country of ours, to
express an independent opinion upon any subject, except perhaps about
the weather. Free speech and press are a thing of the past. The American
junkers and plutocrats are swamping the country with propaganda for a
strong militarism. Our industrial autocrats see the handwriting on the wall
and hope to crush the gathering forces of labor by the bayonet and the machine
gun. The voice of liberty is being stifled in the prisons. Our jails and
penitentiaries are full of political and industrial prisoners who have dared
to hold an opinion of their own and to express it. Men like Debs and others
are immured behind iron bars because they love liberty more than they do
patrioteering. It is to the eternal disgrace of this country that conscientious
objectors, political and industrial prisoners have not yet been given an
amnesty, though even some of the reactionary countries of Europe have long
since restored their social protestants to liberty. If there is any manhood
left in the people of America, they should immediately voice the most compelling
demand for a general amnesty for all political and industrial
prisoners.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rebels against industrial autocracy, such as Debs, Kate Richards O’Hare,
and others, should be the pride of the United States instead of being kept in
dungeons. Woe to a country that has no Debs, Kate O’Hare or Emma Goldman!
They are the voices that cry out the best aspirations of humanity,
even in the face of the gravest danger to themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Speaking of Debs, I was happy to have the opportunity this morning,
before leaving the Federal Prison at Atlanta, to shake hands with the Grand
Old Man of the New Day. If there ever was a martyr to liberty, Debs is
that man. How stupid it is of the Government to jail men of his type! Prison
cannot crush their spirit, nor iron bars and brutality change their conscience.
Their love of humanity transcends the fear of punishment or death. There
are times when the scaffold is the most elevated position for an honest man.
Ideals cannot be imprisoned, nor can the eternal spirit of liberty be exterminated
by shutting up its champions in dungeons or deporting men and women
out of the United States. I feel, I am convinced, that the future belongs to
us—to us who strive to regenerate society, to abolish poverty, misery, war and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>crime, by doing away with the causes of these evils. And even in prison,
where we cannot fight for liberty, we can always struggle for principle.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is this attitude of the political prisoners in all prisons that makes their
lot even harder than that of the average prisoner. It is time the United States
Government should take its head out of the bushes and recognize the existence
of political prisoners in this country. Even in Czarist Russia
the political prisoner was recognized as a man suffering for his ideals. Benighted
America still considers the political just the same as the so-called
common criminal. In the Atlanta Federal Prison the politicals fare even
worse than the average prisoner. A banker who got away with the savings
of poor widows and orphans receives the highest consideration, while the
man who loves humanity more than his own safety is subjected to special
persecution and discrimination.</p>

<p class='c008'>I find that very few essential changes have taken place in the administration
of our prisons within the last 25 years. The same system of brutalizing
and degrading the prisoners still prevails. Only the forms differ
slightly. The dungeon (known as “the hole”), chaining up by the wrists,
clubbing and shooting, are the dominant methods of reformation in Atlanta.
Men are chained to the doors for eight and ten hours consecutively, without
even the opportunity of answering the most pressing demands of nature. I
have known men in the Federal Prison to be kept 21 to 30 days at a stretch in
“the hole,” which is a filthy, dark kennel, not fit for a respectable dog, and
fed on two small slices of bread twice a day. Men are clubbed frequently,
on the least provocation, and recently a young colored boy, “Kid” Smith,
was shot dead for not walking fast enough while being taken to “the hole.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The average type of guard in the Federal Prison is far below that of the
average prisoner, both mentally and morally. Excepting a few decent officers,
of a humane spirit, the majority of the guards are vulgar, brutal and dissipated
men. Some are degenerates of the worst type. At their head is
Deputy Warden Girardeau, formerly in charge of a chain gang. He is a man
of very low mentality who believes in the old-time methods of brutality and
suppression. His tactics look towards the breaking of the prisoner’s spirit
and to the degradation of the inmates. A prison is the last place in the world,
even at its best, to improve a man. But the Atlanta Prison tends chiefly to
dehumanize the prisoners and to crush the last vestige of their manhood and
self-respect. It is the Deputy Warden who is mainly responsible for the inhumanities
and outrages practiced in the Federal Prison. He encourages the
most brutal tendencies of the guards, and even frequently protests and nullifies
the Warden’s more humane attitude. The Deputy Warden is the most
hated man in the prison. The inmates regard him as a religious hypocrite,
insincere and mean-spirited. It is his custom, after reading Sunday service,
to go down to the dungeon and chain men up to the doors. He tantalizes
the hungry victims in “the hole” with the recital of the fine breakfast he had
enjoyed that morning, and in various ways seeks to provoke them into some
unguarded remark in order to increase their punishment. In protest against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the murderous clubbing and shooting of defenseless prisoners, I circulated a
petition in the tailor shop (where I was employed at the time), to call the
attention of the Warden to the terrible situation. The Deputy, hearing about
it, sent for me and asked me what my purpose was. I explained to him the
general indignation regarding the abuse of the prisoners, whereupon he asked
me my opinion of his methods. I told him frankly that his actions did not
square with his religious professions. I said that he was cruel to the men,
that he lacked all sense of justice and fair play, and that I thought—as well
as the majority of the prisoners—that he was a hypocrite. For this I was put
on bread and water in “the hole,” a dark and filthy cell hardly big enough
to stretch out in. After my time in “the hole” had expired, I was sentenced
to solitary confinement for the rest of my time. I spent the last seven and
a half months there.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Federal Prison at Atlanta would profit a great deal both in discipline
and morale by the immediate discharge of Deputy Warden Girardeau.
Warden Fred G. Zerbst is a man far above the Deputy in every sense. He
is a man of modern ideas and of much experience in handling prison inmates.
He believes in the more humane methods of prison management as against
the Deputy’s system of brutal repression. Unfortunately, the Warden is almost
entirely occupied with the outside affairs of the prison, so that the inside
management is practically all in the hands of the Deputy. There is considerable
friction between the two, with deplorable results to the prisoners.
Very frequently the best intentions of the Warden are nullified by the manner
of their application at the hands of the Deputy.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is high time that the public get a look into the inside workings of our
penal institutions. The amount of brutality practiced in them as a matter of
daily routine is almost unbelievable. When will people realize that the criminal
is a man more sinned against than sinning, a victim of our unjust social
and economic arrangements? But after all, prisons and their methods are a
reflex of the conditions in the world outside. With so much injustice, strife
and brutality in the world at large, it is no wonder that prison life mirrors
the same spirit. When we become civilized enough to abolish human slaughter
in the larger prison called society, when we reorganize life on the basis of
human brotherhood and co-operation, we will have no use for prisons.</p>

<p class='c006'>In yesterday’s issue of your paper you printed an article under the
heading, “Berkman Charges Brutal Methods in Atlanta Pen,” and which
article is devoted principally to a personal attack on Deputy Warden
Charles H. Girardeau. It is also charged that a majority of the guards are
vulgar, brutal and dissipated men.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not my custom to reply to ridiculous statements or attacks upon this
institution made by irresponsible individuals, but in this case the attack is
somewhat along personal lines, and in justice to the men so attacked I trust
that you will see fit to accord this communication the same privilege to space
in your columns as that accorded to Mr. Berkman’s foul and unwarranted
personal attack.</p>

<p class='c006'>Deputy Warden Charles H. Girardeau is a Christian gentleman of high
character, clean habits and high ideals, who performs his duties conscientiously
with a view no less for the welfare of those confined here than for
the government under which we live. He has lived in Atlanta for a great
many years and is known intimately by many of Atlanta’s best citizens. I
wonder if any of these people can picture Charlie Girardeau as a low-minded,
brutal fiend who tortures his unfortunate victims in the manner described by
Mr. Berkman. On the one hand we have here a man who has been in Atlanta
business and public life for a great many years, always working to build up
its citizenship and its institutions, always having in view the public welfare.
On the other hand we have Mr. Berkman, who came to this country an
anarchist disguised by the pretense of seeking the benefits of American freedom....
Mr. Berkman served a sentence of 22 years in the Pennsylvania
State prison, after which he made the same kind of an attack on
that institution as he has on this one.</p>

<p class='c006'>Referring to the attack on the character of the guards on duty at this institution,
the guard force here as a whole is constituted of good loyal Americans,
who perform their duties with painstaking care, and it requires much
tact and patience to handle men of all different mentalities and character assembled
in a penal institution. The public little realizes the work performed
by these men at a compensation hardly sufficient to live decently. These guards
are appointed only after passing a standard examination prescribed by the
United States civil service commission after careful investigation showing
that they are loyal Americans, that they are men of good moral character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and standing in the community in which they have lived and that they possess
in a high degree the qualifications necessary for the position. If any great
daily paper believes that these guards are of such character as Mr. Berkman
describes, it would be well to endeavor to rectify the methods by which they
are selected.</p>

<p class='c006'>This institution is open to the public each day except Sundays, and many
thousands of visitors take advantage of this and inspect every department.
Unlike most similar institutions our isolation building, in which are confined
men who can not be brought in any other way to respect the rights of others
and the rules of the institution, is open to the public. Mr. Berkman claims
that these “filthy dungeons” are cleaned up purely for the public visitors;
if that be so they must be cleaned twice each day and it would not be possible
for them to be very filthy at any time.</p>

<p class='c006'>I do not ask to be exonerated on account of any improper conditions existing
at this institution, if such do exist, and I cheerfully accept responsibility
for its management as long as I am its Warden. This management, however,
will be in the interest of the government constituted by the American people
and not in the interest of a revolutionary propaganda seeking for the destruction
of that government and the substitution therefor of the doctrines of Alexander
Berkman and his associates, the abolition of all laws.</p>

<p class='c006'>In your issue of October 4, 1919, Warden Fred G. Zerbst, of the Federal
Prison at Atlanta, makes an alleged reply to my charges of brutality, corruption
and incompetence on the part of the management of the Federal Penitentiary.</p>

<p class='c006'>The outstanding feature of Warden Zerbst’s statement is its entire failure
to discredit my charges, much less to disprove them. I made definite accusations,
gave facts, cited specific instances. The Warden’s only reply is, in
essence, “All’s well, and there is nothing more to be said about it.” That is
the good old traditional policy of the authorities of all penal and other similar
institutions since time immemorial. When facing charges of corruption
and brutality, they resort to the grand gesture of waving the terrible indictment
flippantly aside, with the too-easy declaration, “Nothing to it.” But
an outraged public sentiment, in numerous similar cases, has but too often
exposed this high-and-mighty attitude as the invariable camouflage of rotten
conditions within the prison walls. To cite but one recent instance, still comparatively
vivid in the public memory, will be sufficient. I refer to the case
of Mr. Moyer, former Warden of the Atlanta Federal Prison, who consistently
scoffed at and ridiculed the charges of Julian Hawthorne (the son of his
famous father) till the Hawthorne revelations of prison abuse and outrage,
corroborated by numerous other prisoners and former inmates, were proven
to the hilt, and Warden Moyer summarily dismissed by the Federal Government.</p>

<p class='c006'>I appreciate the spirit of chivalry, of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ésprit de corps</span></i>, that prompts
Warden Zerbst to rush to the rescue of Deputy Warden Girardeau and his
assistants, against whom my indictment is chiefly directed. I have emphasized
in my previous statement that Warden Zerbst is more humane and intelligent
than the Deputy Warden. I may now add that he is also generous,
all too generous, to his official subordinates. But chivalry may be misplaced—it
<i>is</i> misplaced in the present case. It will not do for Mr. Zerbst to barrage
the outrages committed within the prison walls with his loyalty to his official
family. He owes a duty, a prior duty, to the public, to the taxpayers that
support the institution over which he presides. Besides, he also owes a
duty to the men in his keeping, the inmates—about 1,500 helpless unfortunates—a
duty he owes in the interests of justice and humanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>To my specific charge that Deputy Warden Girardeau is brutal and of
low moral and mental calibre, the Warden replies that Mr. Girardeau is a
well-known citizen of Atlanta. ’Tis a rather lame and unconvincing refutation
of my charge. To my indictment of the majority of the guards as vulgar,
brutal and dissipated men, the Warden replies that they have satisfactorily
filled out certain civil service blanks, or passed some other perfunctory examination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Yet in the very next breath he admits that “the work is performed
by these men at a compensation hardly sufficient to live decently.”
In other words, the guards are paid $76.00 per month, and I leave it to the
readers to judge what “high degree of qualification” $76.00-dollar-a-month
men possess, in these days of high cost of living.</p>

<p class='c006'>I emphatically challenge the Warden’s statement that visitors are admitted
to the punishment cells I described as filthy. There are in the Atlanta
Federal Prison <i>two kinds</i> of punishment cells, known respectively as the
“dark hole” and the “light hole.” The difference between the two is extreme.
The “light hole” is a comparatively large cell with a window admitting
some light and air. The “dark hole” is a veritable kennel, wedge-shaped,
about 2½ feet wide at the entrance, 4½ feet at the back, and 6 feet
long. The prisoner is forced to sleep in this dark hole on the floor, on a
filthy mattress, with a bit of rag for covering even in the coldest winter. Its
only toilet facilities is an iron pail, sharp-edged, without any lid, the pail
remaining in the cell 24 hours daily. It is emptied but once a day in the
early morning. That’s the filthy dungeon referred to in my first statement
in the “Constitution,” and I challenge the authorities of the prison to deny
its existence, to deny that men are kept there for thirty days consecutively
and sometimes longer, on an insufficient bread and water diet. No visitors,
except government officials, or personal friends of the prison authorities, are
ever permitted even a glance into this dark dungeon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Can Warden Zerbst successfully deny the above facts? Even a most
superficial investigation would bear me out. Can the Warden contradict
my charges that prisoners are strung up by the wrists for 8 to 12 hours at a
stretch, for 5 to 10 consecutive days? In his statement in the “Constitution”
the Warden fails to deny that men are frequently clubbed, nor does he even
refer to the unprovoked murder of “Kid” Smith by Officer Dean on February
21, 1919. What is the Warden’s reply to these direct charges? His reply
is that “Berkman came to this country as an Anarchist, disguised by the pretence
of seeking the benefits of American freedom.” A rather peculiar justification
for prison brutalities! As a matter of fact, I came to this country
about 32 years ago, a mere boy of 17, at which time I had never heard the
word Anarchist, nor knew its meaning. I became an Anarchist in this country,
and it was just such methods as used by Deputy Warden Girardeau—the
methods of tyranny, oppression and persecution, practiced not only in penitentiaries,
but also in the larger prison called the world—that made me an
Anarchist who seeks more humane forms of social life.</p>

<p class='c006'>Warden Zerbst pretends to believe my charges against the institution to
be but a “ridiculous attack somewhat along personal lines.” Why ridiculous?
Have such things never happened before in prison? Have penal institutions
never been known to resort to brutal methods, or are prison guards generally
acknowledged to be the cream of human kindness, understanding, and good
judgment? Or are “the high moral and intellectual qualifications” of 76-dollar-a-month
men beyond question or dispute?</p>

<p class='c006'>The Warden states that I had made similar charges after my release from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>the Western Penitentiary of Pennsylvania. But he forgets to add that as a
result of my indictment of the brutalities practiced in that prison, investigations
took place, my charges sustained, and practically the whole administration
of the Western Penitentiary radically changed.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a matter of fact, I did not yet tell one-hundredth part of the terrible
things that happen in the daily routine of the Atlanta Federal Prison. For
lack of time and space I did not even mention the criminal neglect of sick
prisoners, the deliberate starvation of the consumptive Nicholas Zogg, who
is actually dying on his feet for lack of proper diet (he being a vegetarian),
the unwholesome food, the vile manner in which it is served to the inmates,
the favoritism of men with a “pull,” the discrimination against political
offenders, the corrupt system of “stool pigeons,” the fake trials at which the
word of one drunken guard outweighs that of a dozen soldiers, political
prisoners and other inmates of character and integrity, whose sole crime consisted
in the expression of an unpopular opinion during the war. I have not
yet referred to the traffic, by guards and other officials, in cocaine, morphine,
and other “dope,” nor to the new 400-loom duck mill, the product of which
is about to come in competition with free labor. Nor have I yet even hinted
at the existence and the actual encouragement of homosexual practices and
other sex aberrations resulting from suppression. I have not started yet,
Mr. Zerbst, but I <i>will</i>, and that very soon.</p>

<p class='c006'>Are these charges just “a personal attack?” Why try to mislead the
public? Most intelligent men <i>know</i> that there are terrible abuses practiced
in penal institutions. There are several investigations of penitentiaries and
insane asylums going on at this very moment. The Federal Prison at Atlanta
is no exception, and my attack is not directed against any particular individual,
but against the system of tyranny, injustice and brutality inside our prisons,
as well as outside. I want to do whatever lies in my power to ameliorate
the conditions under which my unfortunate fellow-men in prisons have to
suffer. I think that Warden Zerbst, as a matter of common humanity, should
be the first to aid my efforts. As the initial step toward this he should eliminate
all physical violence, abolish chaining up and the stool-pigeon system,
and try to secure a living wage for the prison guards. You can’t live these
days on $76.00 a month. Most of the guards are married men, with families.
Within the last two years a large number of new keepers have been engaged
by the penitentiary, displacing the old and outworn men—engaged at $76.00
a month, with disastrous results to the inmates. The struggle for existence
makes the guards surly, cranky, and quarrelsome, constantly conscious of
their grievance because of their low pay, with the tendency to vent their
misery and ill-humor upon the unfortunates in their power. The human element
is of vital importance in prison life.</p>

<p class='c006'>As a matter of common decency and fellow-feeling, in the interest of
both the prisoners and society, I shall be happy to contribute my little share
to bring a bit of sunshine into the dark night of the boys I left behind.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PERSECUTION OF POLITICALS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Practically every political and industrial prisoner in the Federal
Penitentiary at Atlanta, with the exception of Eugene V. Debs, has
been the victim of special discrimination and persecution. In the case
of Debs, the authorities considered it best, owing to his great popularity,
to assign him to the hospital, where he enjoys better food and treatment,
without any particular work to do. At the same time this partial isolation
of Eugene V. Debs from the rest of the prisoners precludes opportunity on
his part for spreading his ideas among the inmates.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the sole exception of Eugene V. Debs, all the other political prisoners
in the Atlanta penitentiary have suffered special persecution:</p>

<p class='c008'>A. Hennecy, a young Socialist from Ohio, was kept in complete solitude
and isolation for eight consecutive months. He was allowed neither to receive
or send mail, no books or papers of any kind, nor was he permitted
work or exercise, or any other privileges usually accorded the average
prisoner. The “crime” for which he was being thus inhumanly punished
was, according to the official report of officer Demoss (formerly whipping
master in the Atlanta prison), “Conversing in a suspicious manner with
another prisoner in the yard, the other prisoner being Louis Kramer.” Both
Hennecy and Kramer were at that time employed in the prison shops and
permitted, like the other inmates, to be out in the yard every Saturday and
Sunday afternoon, privileged to speak to anyone.</p>

<p class='c006'>A. Hennecy is now finishing a one-year sentence in the Delaware County
Jail, Ohio, having been released from the Atlanta prison in February, 1919.
He served in Atlanta two years on the charge of obstructing the draft. His
present sentence is the result of his failure to register on June 4th, 1917.</p>

<p class='c006'>Walter Hershberger, a conscientious objector, serving 20 years for refusing
to don a military uniform. (His sentence has since been reduced
to four years.) Herschberger has been kept in solitary confinement and
isolation almost continuously since the early part of December, 1918. His
solitary is “broken” by frequent visits to the dungeon, a dark hole 2½×4½×6
feet, where he is kept on an insufficient bread-and-water diet for periods
ranging from 3 to 15 days. He was in isolation when I left the prison on
October 1st, 1919.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nicholas Zenn Zogg (spelled on the prison records Zough) serving ten
years on the charge of aiding a young man to evade the draft. He was transferred
to the Atlanta penitentiary from the Federal prison at McNeill’s
Island, State of Washington. Zogg is in the last stages of tuberculosis, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>is being practically starved to death by the refusal of the authorities to permit
him to buy or to receive suitable food from friends. He has been a strict
vegetarian all his life, as were his father and grandfather before him, and
he is neither physically nor conscientiously able to partake of the regular
prison diet. He is forced to live mostly on oatmeal, badly prepared and
served in the most unpalatable manner. Notwithstanding the fact that
Zogg is barely able to walk about, he has been repeatedly thrown into the
dungeon for alleged breaches of discipline.</p>

<p class='c006'>Jack Randolph, an I. W. W., serving 10 years for opposition to the war,
is in very delicate health and unable to perform the amount of work demanded
of him in the tailor shop, was repeatedly punished in the dungeon and in
solitary.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Red” Massey, an I. W. W., from New Orleans, sent to the Atlanta
prison on a frame-up charge under the Mann Act. This man has been kept
in solitary and in isolation almost continuously for a year, and punished
in the dungeon on the slightest pretext.</p>

<p class='c006'>Morris Becker, sentenced to 20 months on the charge of conspiracy
against the draft. This young man, of very slight physique, weighing about
100 pounds, and for over a year unable to eat anything except bread and
oatmeal because of his poor physical condition and also because he was a
vegetarian, was ordered to do yard work. His job consisted in wheeling
a large wheelbarrow full of bricks and cement up a very steep incline.
Becker was unable to perform the work. For his “refusal to work” he was
sent to the dungeon and there kept for 21 days on two slices of bread and
water a day. He was released from the dungeon almost half dead, whereupon
the authorities admitted that he was unable to perform the hard toil
allotted to him. He was then assigned to the tailor shop.</p>

<p class='c006'>Louis Kramer, serving 2 years for conspiracy to obstruct the draft,
assigned, like Becker, to the same yard work, and equally unable to perform
the task. Kept in the dungeon 21 days on bread and water. Subsequently
repeatedly punished in the dark cell on the slightest or no provocation,
chained up by the wrists to the door, and kept in isolation for 5 months till
his discharge in June, 1919.</p>

<p class='c006'>Louis Kramer is now serving one year in the Essex County Penitentiary,
N. J., for refusing to register.</p>

<p class='c006'>Alexander Berkman, sentenced to 2 years on the charge of conspiracy
to obstruct the draft. Kept in the dungeon for five days on bread and water
for circulating a petition in the tailor shop, protesting to the Warden against
the brutal clubbings of defenceless prisoners; also in protest against the
unprovoked murder of “Kid” Smith by Officer Dean. Sentenced to solitary
and isolation for 7½ months, for calling the attention of Deputy Warden
Girardeau to the brutalities practiced by the keepers in his charge, and for
calling the Deputy a hypocrite. Kept thirty consecutive hours in the “dark
hole” with the blind door on, which almost absolutely excludes all light and
air, with the result that the man thus punished is put through the torture of
gradual suffocation,—one of the worst forms of punishment known in prison
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>life. During three months forbidden to receive or send mail, read papers
or books, or to have any exercise whatever. Held in solitary and in isolation
continuously from February 21st, to the day of discharge, October 1st,
1919.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an instance of wilful brutality practiced upon the ordinary prisoner,
I may cite the case of A. Popoff. In the latter part of 1917, while in a state
of temporary mental aberration, Popoff killed a former Deputy Warden of
the prison. He was taken out for trial and sentenced to life imprisonment.
Upon his return from the court, the Atlanta penitentiary authorities confined
him in a dark dungeon and kept him there continuously for two years,
most of the time on a bread-and-water diet. Almost every week Popoff was
subjected to a terrific beating by several guards, after which he would be
carried to the hospital unconscious, and later again returned to the dungeon.
This treatment was kept up from 1917 till August, 1919. Popoff became a
raving maniac, and still his punishment in the dungeon continued. Finally,
in the latter part of 1919, he was transferred to an insane asylum.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is one of the instances of a prisoner of infantile mentality being
deliberately driven into insanity by torture and by barbaric treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is but a small fragment of the numerous brutalities practiced
daily in the U. S. Penitentiary at Atlanta, Ga. The lot of the average
prisoner is hard enough, but the politicals are particularly discriminated
against in the matter of work, of general treatment, and specifically in relation
to their mail privileges. A young keeper, whose education does not
exceed the three R’s, is the chief prison censor, with the result that most of
the mail sent to the politicals never reaches its destination.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the daily routine of prison life, there are many and various opportunities
to make the existence of the inmates unbearable. In Atlanta there
are quite a number of petty officials, from the Deputy down, who make the
best of these opportunities, especially in regard to the politicals. To the
average prison keeper, the political offender is a non-understandable thing.
He knows that the convict is either a murderer, robber or a thief, but that
a man should be willing to go to prison for no material benefit to himself,
is beyond his ken. That one should risk his liberty merely for the sake of
ideas or ideals, is almost beyond belief and is positive proof—in the eyes
of the average prison keeper—that the man is either crazy or hopelessly
depraved. Such a man need expect neither understanding, sympathy, nor
mercy. The average man is inclined to distrust and hate the thing he does
not understand, and we always try to suppress the thing we hate. Hence,
the more than usually inhumane and brutal treatment of the political prisoners
in the penal institutions of America.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>IN CONCLUSION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>The results attained by penal institutions are the very opposite of the ends
sought. The modern form of “civilized” revenge kills, figuratively speaking,
the enemy of the individual citizen, but it breeds in his place the enemy
of society. The prisoner of the State does not regard the person he injured
as his particular enemy—as did the member of the primitive tribe, for instance,
feeling the wrath and revenge of the wronged one. Instead, he looks
upon the State as his direct punisher; in the representatives of the law he
sees his personal enemies. He nurtures his wrath, and wild thoughts of
revenge fill his mind. His hate toward the persons directly responsible, in
his estimation, for his misfortune—the arresting officer, the jailer, the prosecuting
attorney, judge and jury—gradually widens in scope, and the poor
unfortunate becomes an enemy of society as a whole. Thus, while our penal
institutions are supposed to protect society from the prisoner so long as he
remains one, they cultivate in him the germs of social hatred and enmity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Deprived of his liberty, his rights, and the enjoyment of life; all his natural
impulses, good and bad alike, suppressed; subjected to indignities and
disciplined by harsh and often most inhumane methods, generally maltreated
and abused by official brutes whom he despises and hates, the prisoner comes
to curse the fact of his birth, the woman that bore him, and all those responsible,
in his eyes, for his misery. He is brutalized by the treatment he
receives, and by the revolting sights he is forced to witness in prison. What
manhood he may have possessed is soon eradicated by the “discipline.” His
impotent rage and bitterness are turned into hatred toward everything and
everybody, the feeling growing in intensity as the years of misery come and
go. He broods over his troubles, and the desire to revenge himself grows
on him. Soon it becomes a fixed determination. Society had made him
an outcast: it is his natural enemy. Nobody had shown him either kindness
or mercy; he will be merciless to the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>Then he is released. His former friends spurn him; he is no more
recognized by his acquaintances. Society points its finger at the ex-convict.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>He is looked upon with scorn, derision, and disgust. He is distrusted and
abused. He has no money, and there is little charity for the “moral leper.”
He finds himself a social Ishmael, with everybody’s hand turned against
him—and he turns his hand against everybody else.</p>

<p class='c008'>The penal and the alleged “protective” functions of prisons thus defeat
their own ends. Their work is not merely unprofitable; it is worse than
useless. It is positively and absolutely detrimental to the best interests of
society.</p>

<p class='c008'>There exists no other institution among the diversified “achievements”
of modern society which, while assuming a most important role in the destinies
of mankind, has proven a more reprehensible failure. Millions of
dollars are annually expended for the maintenance of prisons—a great deal
more than is spent on educational institutions in this country. That money
could be invested with as much profit and less harm in government bonds of
the planet Mars, or sunk in the Atlantic. No amount of punishment can
obviate or “cure” crime so long as prevailing conditions, in and out of
prison, drive men to it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>or do you approve of the sentiments expressed by <strong>ALEXANDER
BERKMAN</strong> in his statement, in re deportation, made to the
officials of the U. S. Immigration Service:</p>

<p class='c012'>I deny the right of any one—individually or collectively—to
set up an inquisition of thought.
Thought is, or should be, free. My social views
and political opinions are my personal concern.
I owe no one responsibility for them. Responsibility
begins only with the effects of thought
expressed in action. Not before. Free thought,
necessarily involving freedom of speech and
press, I may tersely define thus: no opinion a
law—no opinion a crime. For the government to
attempt to control thought, to prescribe certain
opinions or proscribe others, is the height of
despotism.</p>

<p class='c000'>Do you realize the menace of the Anti-Anarchist Law, under
cover of which scores of men and women—not only Anarchists,
but Socialists, I. W. W.’s, and ordinary workers—are arrested
daily and held for deportation?</p>

<p class='c000'>As <strong>EMMA GOLDMAN</strong> pointed out at her deportation hearing:</p>

<p class='c012'>Under the mask of the same Anti-Anarchist law
every criticism of a corrupt administration, every
attack on Governmental abuse, every manifestation
of sympathy with the struggling of another
country in the pangs of a new birth—in short,
every free expression of untrammeled thought
may be suppressed utterly, without even the semblance
of an unprejudiced hearing or a fair trial.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
